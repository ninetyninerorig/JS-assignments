        <h1>Difference between Var,Let and Const</h1>
        <p>Var is mainly used to introduce new variables into a code. They are applicable throughout the code
            but cannot be used in any blocks within a code.</p>
        <script>
            var a=14;
            console.log(a); //displays value of a
        </script>
        <p>Let is to reuse any variable again in any block of code which is present within the main code.</p>
        <script>
            let a=14; //a variable
            {
                let a=15; //same variable, different value
                console.log(a);
            }console.log(a);
        </script>
        <p>Const is used to define a variable whose value stays fixed throughout the code and cannot be changed</p>
        <script>
            const a=14;
            const a=11;//gives error
        </script>
